Domestic servant registers (DSR) have been an important source to study women's work. It is one of few sources, that specifically address the occupational activities of women and gives insight in patterns of migration. Moreover, DSRs are fine grained sources providing near real-time information on the house address level and are available for multiple countries and decades making them excellent sources for research (datasets).
Historians and sociale science history researchers have used DSRs abundantly, but often only for a specific town or for a sample of individuals from a particular region. The reason for this, is that uncovering civil servant registries is labour intensive and registries have different formats making it harder to link regionally dispersed registers.
Focussing on the civil servant registries of 1887-1909 in the Dutch town Harderwijk, we show how a national or even international network of civil registries may be build using Linked Open Data. Borrowing from Schema and other vocabularies we show how multiple registries can be spatially and temporally connected. Additionally, we illustrate how observations from civil servant registries can be connected to other sources, such as civil records, enhancing life course analysis on for example social inequality, marriage patterns and migration.
