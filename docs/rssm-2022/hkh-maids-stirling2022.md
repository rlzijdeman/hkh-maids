Why?
- Problem 1: Representation of women in historical research
On the source:
- available in various Western countries;
- fine grained info on occupation;
- house address;
- type of family;

If it is that good, then why hasn't it been used before?
- it actually has been, extensively, but:
- often in isolation e.g. for a specific regiona and period;




- Problem 2: Severed link between local archive (source) and research result
